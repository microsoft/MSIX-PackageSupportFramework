# Package Support Framework
This project provides tools, libraries, documentation and samples for creating runtime fixes (also called *fixups*) for compatibility issues that enable Windows desktop applications to be distributed and executed as MSIX packaged apps.

Here are some common examples where you can find the Package Support Framework (PSF) useful:

* Your app can't find some DLLs when launched. You may need to set your current working directory. You can learn about the required current working directory in the original shortcut before you converted to MSIX.
* The app writes to the install folder. This issue typically shows up as ACCESS DENIED errors in [Process Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) as demonstrated in the following image.
    ![ProcMon Logfile](procmon_logfile.png)
* Your app needs to pass arguments to the executable when launched. You can easily configure arguments by using [PSF Launcher](https://github.com/microsoft/MSIX-PackageSupportFramework/tree/master/PsfLauncher).

You can learn more about how to identify compatibility issues [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/msix/psf/package-support-framework#identify-packaged-application-compatibility-issues). If you have feedback, please create [an issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/MSIX-PackageSupportFramework/issues) or post a message in our [tech community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Package-Support-Framework/bd-p/Package-Support).

## Get the pre-built Package Support Framework binaries
Download the Package Support Framework binaries from [Nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.PackageSupportFramework). To extract the binaries, rename the package extension to .zip, unzip the file, and locate the binaries in the /bin folder. In a future release we are planning to make it easier to locate the binaries directly on GitHub.

## Branch structure
Package Support Framework adopts a **develop** and **master** branching style.

### Master
The **master** branch represents the source in the most recent NuGet package. The code in this branch is the most stable. Do not fork off this branch for development.

### Develop
The **develop** branch has the latest code. Keep in mind that there might be features in this branch that is not yet in **master**. Make a private fork off the **develop** branch to make your own contributions to Package Support Framework.

## Fixup metadata
Each fixup and the PSF Launcher has a metadata file in XML format. Each file contains the following:

* `Version`: The version of the Package Support Framework is in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format according to [Sem Version 2](https://semver.org/).
* `MinimumWindowsPlatform`: The minimum windows version required for the fixup or PSF Launcher.
* `Description`: A short description of the fixup.
* `WhenToUse`: Heuristics on when you should apply the fixup.

The metadata file schema is provided [here](MetadataSchema.xsd).

## Data/Telemetry
The Package Support Framework includes telemetry that collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve our products and services. Read Microsoft's [privacy statement to learn more](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement). However, data will be collected only when both of the following conditions are met:

* The Package Support Framework binaries are used from the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.PackageSupportFramework) on a Windows 10 computer.
* The user has enabled collection of data on the computer.

The NuGet package contains signed binaries and will collect usage data from the computer. Telemetry is not collected when the binaries are built locally by cloning the repo or downloading the binaries directly.

## Script support
Scripts allow IT Pros to customize the app for the user environment dynamically. The scripts typically change registry keys or perform file modifications based on the machine or server configuration.

Each exe defined in the application manifest can have their own scripts. PSF allows one PowerShell script to be run before an exe runs, and one PowerShell script to be ran after the exe runs.

### Prerequisite to allow scripts to run
In order to allow scripts to run you need to set the execution policy to unrestricted or RemoteSigned. Because this might be set automatically by GroupPolicy, you may instead choose to supply the appropriate execution policy for the script in the json configuration.

If setting the execution policy externally, run the one of the two following powershell commands to set the execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` or `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` depending if you want the execution policy to be remoteSigned or unrestricted. The execution policy needs to be set for both the 64-bit powershell executable and the 32-bit powershell executable.  Make sure to open each version of powershell and run the command shown above.

Here are the locations of each executable.
* If on a 64-bit computer
  * 64-bit: %SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
  * 32-bit: %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
* If on a 32-bit computer
  * 32-bit: %SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
  
[More information about PowerShell Execution Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-6)

Some organizations set the execution policy using GroupPolicy, which prevents setting the policy by using Set-ExecutionPolicy. To overcome this you will either have to sign the StartingScriptWrapper.ps1 used to run your script or set the optional stopOnScriptError setting to `'-ByPass'` as shown in the example.

### How to enable scripts to run with PSF
In order to specify what scripts will run for each packaged exe you will need to modify the config.json file.  To tell PSF to run a script before the execution of the packaged exe add a configuration item called "startScript".  To tell PSF to run a script after the packaged exe finishes add a configuration item called "endScript".

#### Script configuration items
The following are the configuration items available at the application level.

| Key name                | Value type | Required? | Default  | Description
|-------------------------|------------|-----------|----------|---------|
| stopOnScriptError       | boolean    | No        | false    | When set to true, an error in the StartScript will prevent the appliction from being started. |
| scriptExecutionMode     | string     | No        | empty    | May be empty or set an acceptable powershell command line control such as: |
| | | | |  `'-ByPass'` |
| | | | |  `'-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned'` |
| | | | |  `'-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted'` |
| startScript             | object     | No        | empty    | See below. |
| endScript               | object     | No        | empty    | See below. |
 
The following are the configuration items available for the start and end script objects.  The ending script ignores the following configuration items: waitForScriptToFinish, and stopOnScriptError.

| Key name                | Value type | Required? | Default  | Description
|-------------------------|------------|-----------|----------|---------|
| scriptPath              | string     | Yes       | N/A      | The path to the script including the name and extension.  The Path starts from the root directory of the application.
| scriptArguments         | string     | No        | empty    | Space delimited argument list.  The format is the same for a PowerShell script call.  This string gets appended to scriptPath to make a valid PowerShell.exe call.
| runInVirtualEnvironment | boolean    | No        | true     | If the script should run in the same virtual environment that the packaged exe runs in.
| runOnce                 | boolean    | No        | true     | If the script should run once per user, per version.
| showWindow              | boolean    | No        | false    | If the powershell window is shown.
| waitForScriptToFinish   | boolean    | No        | true     | If the packaged exe should wait for the starting script to finish before starting.
| timeout                 | DWORD      | No        | INFINITE | How long the script will be allowed to execute.  If elapsed the script will be stopped.

### Sample configuration
Here is a sample configuration using two different exes.
<pre>
    {
  "applications": [
    {
      "id": "Sample",
      "executable": "Sample.exe",
      "workingDirectory": "",
      "stopOnScriptError": false,
      "scriptExecutionMode": "-ByPass"
	  "startScript":
	  {
		"scriptPath": "RunMePlease.ps1",
		"scriptArguments": "\\\"First argument\\\" secondArgument",
		"runInVirtualEnvironment": true,
		"showWindow": true,
		"waitForScriptToFinish": false
	  },
	  "endScript":
	  {
		"scriptPath": "RunMeAfter.ps1",
		"scriptArguments": "ThisIsMe.txt"
	  }
    },
	{
      "id": "CPPSample",
      "executable": "CPPSample.exe",
      "workingDirectory": "",
	  "startScript":
	  {
		"scriptPath": "CPPStart.ps1",
		"scriptArguments": "ThisIsMe.txt",
		"runInVirtualEnvironment": true
	  },
	  "endScript":
	  {
		"scriptPath": "CPPEnd.ps1",
		"scriptArguments": "ThisIsMe.txt",
    "runOnce": false
	  }
    }
  ],
  "processes": [
    ...(taken out for brevity)
  ]
}
</pre>

 ### Enabling the app to exit if the starting script encounters an error.
 The scripting change allows users to tell PSF to exit the application if the starting script fails.  To do this, add the pair "stopOnScriptError": true to the application configuration (not the script configuration).
 
 ### The combination of `stopOnScriptError: true` and `waitForScriptToFinish: false` is not supported
 This is an illegal configuration combination and PSF will throw the error ERROR_BAD_CONFIGURATION.

## Fixup Metadata
Each fixup and the PSF Launcher has a metadata file in xml format.  Each file contains the following  
 1. Version:  The version of the PSF is in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format according to [Sem Version 2](https://semver.org/)
 2. Minimum Windows Platform the the minimum windows version required for the fixup or PSF Launcher.
 3. Description: Short description of the fixup.
 4. WhenToUse: Heuristics on when you should apply the fixup.

Additionally, we have the XSD for the metadata files.  THe XSD is located in the solution folder.

## Data/Telemetry
Telemetry datapoint has been hooked to collect usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve our products and services. Read Microsoft's [privacy statement to learn more](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement). However, data will be collected only when the PSF binaries are used from [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=packagesupportframework) 
on Windows 10 devices and only if users have enabled collection of data. The Nuget package has binaries signed and will collect usage data from machine. When the binaries are built locally by cloning the repo or downloading the bits, then telemetry is not collected.
